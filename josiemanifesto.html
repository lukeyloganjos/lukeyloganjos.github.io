	<h1> The Manifesto of Josie </h1>
	<body id="manifesto">
	<p>I always give first. I expense my emotions and my heart, in order to please others; regardless of if this action is deserved. I am often overlooked by the ones I thought cared, because they only use me for this nurturing nature that I have embodied. I love with a full heart and forgive as much as possible. I realize that relationships are fluid and can come and go. However, I also realize that family will always stay.  </p>
	<p> I have failed. I have given my all and have come up short. Again and again. This failure is what drives me. I realized, edit, and correct these failures. If I do not fail, then I do not truly understand what success means. </p>
	<p> Most importantly. I AM BEAUTIFUL. I AM STRONG. I AM LOVED. I am MY perfect self. I do what I want, and I live MY life. I am the hero that I strive to be. I look into the future and decide that I am living my life for that person. I am doing now what future me would look back on and appreciate. </p>
