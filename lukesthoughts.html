	<h1> Dear Josie, </h1>
<body>
	<p class="letter"> During some of the more trying times in your life, I have stayed quite. I have always been there for you, but maybe not as helpful as you would have liked. And I think that the reason of that is because I just could not understand. I could not understand why bad things happened to you, and I could not understand how other people could be causing these things. So I think, I stayed relatively quite because I wanted to have an answer or a reason that I could rationalize with myself, as to why shit seemed to always being thrown your way. I believe that I have come up with that answer, and it is a pretty obvious one. 
	</p>
	<p class="letter"> Jealousy and intimidation. It was so simple! Now, people would never admit these things, of course. But let me explain my claim. </p>
	<p class="letter"> Jealousy: People are envious creatures. We always believe that the grass is always greener on the other side and we are annoyed of the life we actually have because we constantly strive for that greener pasture. I truly believe that people viewed you, as the "other side". Josie, you are so smart and so hardworking that people are just jealous of you. They wish that they had the ability to do half of the things that you are. I mean fuck, you work like ten jobs, coach 5 teams, go to school, be a "aunt", and still find the time for other activities. </p>
	<p class="letter"> I think intimidation somewhat plays off of jealousy. People do not know how to handle you. You have your head set so straight, you are so driven, you are so compassionate and caring, you are so strong, you are funny, goofy, clever, people look up to you, you are smarter than most people I know, you are artistic, you are beautiful. Do you want me to stop? I could totally keep going! HAHA. But see!? You have so many virtuous qualities that people do not know how to take you. For example, dumb ass Alex. You are so much more driven and understanding, that I believe he always felt the need to be better than himself. And I just think that something like that could not have worked out forever. You need someone who embraces you fully. We meet our soul mate, when we are on our souls path. When you saving lives and taking the world by storm, that is when you will meet your man. Date and whatever now, have fun. But know that when you are doing what you love and living the life you want, that is when you are going to meet the one. So tell mom to get off your back! </p>
	<p> Okay, I know I've rambled on for about as long as I can. Ignore the grammar and spelling. Also ignore the random rants that are embedded throughout this letter. I kind of just wrote this by starting to think of you, what you've been through and how I felt about it. I think about you a lot, Josie. I know I might not be the most persistant brother, but I am always in your corner- ready to start swinging at the poor soul who messes with you. </p>
