		<p> Josie, I love you so much! You are my sister, my best friend, my role model, and someone that I never want to lose. I look at you and I see so much passion and drive, that I just want to be around to see the success that you acquire throughout your life. You have had to deal with a lot of shit along the way, but you have grown to be a truly amazing WOMAN! You are so strong. I made this website (unfinished, making this shit is hard!) so that you always know who you are, and how I think of you. You have the power to inspire a ton of people along your life, and I am already one of those people. I strive to be so hardworking, and so caring, and so positive; just like you! </p>
		<p id="doit"> So scroll through this and enjoy your present </p>
